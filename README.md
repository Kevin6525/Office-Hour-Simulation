# Office-Hour-Simulation-with-Maps
The program runs the office simulation using priority queues and multimaps. We will randomly have students come in (No more than the professor's total number of students) and assign priority to each students' questions. Questions range randomly from 1-20 minutes. After the simulations, there will be a summary of the average duration of each question, the average number of students who attended the office hour and how long the professor went over his allotted hour to help students. The professor will also be given a summary including all the names of students who attended the office hour and their question subjects. The output can be sorted by either question subject or student name and individual reports can also be generated by same method.

Includes: multimaps, priority queues, stacks
