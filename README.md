# Office-Hour-Simulation-with-Maps
The program runs the office simulation using priority queues. (Same base as the priority queue repo, but instead will output some information to an output file using a multimap)
The map will output summary of the 100 office hour simulations collectively. This includes: how many times a student visited, their name, and the subject they visited for.
